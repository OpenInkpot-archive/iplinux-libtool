## This test is broken for several reasons:
## - It's linking a shared lib against a static lib.  This is not
##   portable, and we even give a warning about this.
## - The shared lib is not using any symbols from the static lib.
## - The test program is linked against the shared lib and using
##   symbols from the static lib.
